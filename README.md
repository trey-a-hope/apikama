======
A high-performance FastAPI service that seamlessly integrates with [Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com/nakama/) game servers.

## Getting Started

This API is quick and easy to use, reducing the complexity of working with the native client API. The first required step is generating your **API key**. 

This key is a combination of the **host**, **SSL flag**, **HTTP port**, and **secret server key**. However, sending the server key over HTTPS is dangerous for several reasons, including:

- The server key is exposed in server logs
- The key appears in browser history
- The key is visible in URLs, making it vulnerable to accidental sharing
- The key gets cached at various points along the request path
- The key may be captured by analytics and error tracking systems

Fortunately, this API has already taken care of that for you. Use the built-in  [utility encrypter](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html#before-you-begin) endpoint to generate your API key, which you'll then use for all API calls with that specific server configuration. 

Just enter the information that is asked for when hitting endpoint **/api-keys/generate**

Think of it as your personal API keyâ€”keep it safe and secure.
